# YOLOv8 hyperparameters optimized for tiny electrical symbol detection
# These parameters override the defaults in train_tiny_objects.py

# Loss weights (higher box loss to prioritize location accuracy)
box: 12.0  # Box loss gain (higher for tiny objects to focus on accurate localization)
cls: 0.6   # Class loss gain
dfl: 2.5   # Distribution focal loss gain

# Augmentation settings - enhanced for tiny objects
hsv_h: 0.015  # Hue variation - subtle to preserve symbol appearance
hsv_s: 0.7    # Saturation variation - higher to handle blueprint contrast changes
hsv_v: 0.5    # Value variation - higher to handle blueprint lighting differences
degrees: 10.0  # Max rotation degrees - lowered to maintain symbol orientation
translate: 0.3  # Translation factor - increased to handle varying positions
scale: 0.6     # Scale factor - increased for symbol size variations
shear: 7.0     # Shear factor - lowered to maintain symbol shape
perspective: 0.0003  # Perspective transform - very minimal for tiny objects
flipud: 0.4    # Flip up-down probability
fliplr: 0.5    # Flip left-right probability
mosaic: 1.0    # Mosaic probability - maximum 
mixup: 0.4     # Mixup probability - increased for small dataset
copy_paste: 0.4  # Copy-paste probability

# Advanced training settings
dropout: 0.1   # Feature dropout probability
label_smoothing: 0.05  # Label smoothing epsilon
nbs: 64        # Nominal batch size
cos_lr: true   # Use cosine learning rate scheduler
close_mosaic: 10  # Close mosaic augmentation N epochs before end
overlap_mask: true  # Masks should overlap during box scaling

# Optimizer settings
optimizer: 'AdamW'  # Optimizer (AdamW typically better for small objects)
lr0: 0.001     # Initial learning rate
lrf: 0.01      # Final learning rate factor (fraction of lr0)
momentum: 0.937  # SGD momentum/Adam beta1
weight_decay: 0.0005  # Optimizer weight decay
warmup_epochs: 5.0  # Longer warmup for stable training
warmup_momentum: 0.5  # Initial warmup momentum
